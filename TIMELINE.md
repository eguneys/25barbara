## Brainstorm Ideas

### Overall design

- A Platformer with the character can, run, jump, double jump, shoot, climb.

- Enemies, character jump on enemies to squash, or shoot them from distance.

- Enemies can attack, causing damage, and they have a certain life.

- Collectible coins, life, reflenish jump, more shoot damage, power suit, shield armor

- Character has 3 lives
- When character gets hurt, it loses some of its collected coins, if it gets hurt with no coins, it dies.

- One guide
  - shows tutorials
- One side kick
  - follows around everywhere
- One weak enemy, a dog
  - patrols, attacks when approached on short distance
- One tricky enemy, a bat
  - air patrol, charges an attack on long distance sight
- One boss, a tree
  - leave attack, shoots leaves on some directions at air level
  - root attack, shoots roots out of ground
  - wind attack, something about wind.
  - boss is vulnerable at certain points player can shoot into.

- Static obstacles like, spikes, shooting arrows or dead lava causes instant death

- Ground, high platforms, walls, bounce platforms, one side platforms, on off platforms, weak platforms, spikes

- Decorations, plants, auto tiling tiles, Decals on walls or inside solid platforms, background.

- Environment
  - 1 tutorial, 3 main sections, and lead to a boss section total of 5 sections. And one secret special level.
  - Based on theme

- Visual Effects, dust on land, double jump indicator visual, shoot bullet shells, drop juice on death, star flash on collectible collect, flash on power up collect, flash on get hit knockback.

- Secret platforms on air, with a visual cue, that leads to extra collectibles.
- When extra collectible collection is completed, secret special level unlocks.
- Secret special level includes, lots of mana.


- Shoot damage is proportional to player's mana. 

Extra ideas:

- An electric lighting is cast upon to kill all enemies in sight.
- Homing missiles follow the player.
- Elemental burst, release a burst of energy, (fire ice) to clear enemies near you.
